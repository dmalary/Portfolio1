    <h3 class='about-me'>About Me</h3>

    <p>When asked what 3 words would best describe me, I would say:
      <ul>
        <li>Curious</li>
        <li>Stubborn</li>
        <li>A Paradox</li>
      </ul>
    In the same way most animals spend their waking hours seeking food, I look to answer the numerous questions I come accross everyday, and I do so with a stubborn and relentless pursuit.
    I decided to pursue computer programming and web development in order to provide myself with the skills I feel will allow me to succeed in my life.</p>
